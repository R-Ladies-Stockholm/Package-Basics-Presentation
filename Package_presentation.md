- Recent transplant to Stockholm.
- Government fishereies researcher turned data scientist .
- Built R-packages FastrCAT, rrza, and fishgutr.
- Made my first PR during Tidyverse Dev Day on the dplyr package üéâ.
- I also love crafting and sea critters üòç!

R Packages on CRAN
========================================================
incremental: true 
left:60%





![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4](Package_presentation-figure/unnamed-chunk-4-1.gif)
***
As of this year
- 15007 on CRAN 
- ~ 2116 on GitHub (includes dev versions of CRAN Packages)
- 1741 on BioConductor
- ~ 18864 + known packages!  ü§Ø



So many packages, why make more?

***
- A üì¶ can be just for you  
- A üì¶ can be specific to your use case  
- üì¶'s are easily sharable 
- üì¶'s are great for method development, easy documentation  
- üì¶'s encapsulate a project, all files in one place!


Elisabeth why I built a package
========================================================

- share new stats methods


Why I built a package
========================================================
incremental: true 
left:16%

![fastrcatdata](Package_presentation_files/fastrcatdata.png)

***
- Data was trapped in a particular type of oceanographic file  
- Thousands of these files were created each field season  
- Past methods ment data wasn't available for more than a year   
- I wanted to use the data while still out on the research cruise üö¢ üìà!

So, I built FastrCAT
========================================================
incremental: true 
left:50%

![fastrcatdata](Package_presentation_files/fastrcat_coll.png)

***
FastrCAT...

- streamlined the data aquisition
- did not have to wait a year or more
- has functions to produce maps, plots and reports
- the package was used succesfully this past field season!

First Steps: Picking a Style
========================================================
![abfab](Package_presentation_files/abfab.webp)

- Google Style Guide

- Your job might also have its own guide too. 

What is human readable code?
========================================================

***
- Wikipedia defines human readable as, "A human-readable medium or human-readable format is a representation of data or information that can be naturally read by humans."  

Basics...
- meaningful file names, w/o spaces
- use snake_case or CamelCase, != both or dot.case
- objects or variables are nouns
- functions are verbs


Documentation
========================================================

- how creating a package forces you to document everything
- documentation is realtive to your audience
- unhelpful documentation
- helpful documentation


Documentation - E
========================================================
- function documentation example
- why is this helpful
- give a reproducable example
- who are your users and how you write the documentation
- example glm object


Documentation
========================================================
- package level example
- why is this helpful
- should you add a data set


Documentation
========================================================
- vingette example
- you want your users to understand, give examples


Elisabeth Example One
=======================================================

- targeting your users
- Journal Article about package and examples with theory
- what to do, documentation in line level you expect from users

Nissa Example One
=======================================================
![](https://www.facebook.com/LADbible/videos/973460716173882/)

***

- how error writing is documentation too
- writting errors to help your users


Careful with your dependencies
=======================================================

![somanypackages](Package_presentation_files/somanypackages.jpg)

***
- some overview of dependencies


Elisabeth Example Two
=======================================================

- import vs depends
- which r version with uploading to CRAN r devel


Nissa Example Two
=======================================================
- maps without the internet
- why I didn't use ggmap
- how did I realize this was an issue
- how did I solve this issue
- where it went in the package folder hierarchy
- what were all the packages I used
- show how it was written in the package/ folders

How your users interct with your package
=======================================================
![human package interaction]()
***
- transition slide
- interacting

Elisabeth Example Three
=======================================================

- what is the output of your package
- in r oop, classes
- print glm and formats example, plot function
- model object look similar across packages



Nissa Example Three
=======================================================

- from the console
- why I did it this way for my users
- how you share





Last Slide 
========================================================
- live package build in Rstudio
